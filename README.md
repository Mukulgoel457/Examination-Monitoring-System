# Examination Monitoring System

## Introduction
The Examination Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to automate the process of managing and monitoring examinations. Built using React and Vite, this system leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless experience for administrators and students alike. The project integrates several plugins and tools to enhance the development workflow and improve performance.

## Technical Setup
- **Framework**: React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Ensures that updates are reflected instantly without needing a page refresh, which is crucial during development for efficiency.
- **ESLint**: Helps maintain code quality through strict syntax and style guidelines.

## Front End
The front end of the Examination Monitoring System is built using React, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. It uses Vite as the build tool for a faster and more efficient development experience.

### Features
- **Dynamic Forms**: React components for form inputs that validate data in real-time.
- **Live Updates**: Utilizing WebSocket for real-time updates during examinations.
- **Accessibility Features**: High contrast modes and screen reader support ensure that the application is accessible to all users.

## Backend
The backend is implemented using Node.js, which handles all server-side logic and database interactions. It provides RESTful APIs that the front end consumes.

### Security
- **Authentication**: Secure login mechanisms with JWT for maintaining user sessions.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to ensure users can only access appropriate resources.

## Database
The system uses MySQL for data storage. Database schemas are designed to support complex queries efficiently.

### Tables
- **Users**: Stores user credentials and roles.
- **Exams**: Contains exam details, questions, and options.
- **Results**: Records students' answers and grades.



## Plugins Used
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Utilizes Babel for implementing Fast Refresh. This setup helps in maintaining state while making changes to the React components, providing a smoother development experience.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses the SWC compiler which acts as a faster alternative to Babel, improving build performance.

## Installation Guide
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishita3003/Examination-Monitoring-System.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Examination-Monitoring-System
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. **Run the developement server**:
   npm run dev

## Usage
* ***Admin Dashboard:*** Allows administrators to oversee all examinations, manage questions, and view performance metrics.
* ***Student Dashboard:*** Students can log in to view upcoming exams, take exams, and check their previous scores.
* ***Performance Analytics:*** Graphical representations of student performance help in quick assessment and remedial actions.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



### Additional Information
- **Front End**: Describes the user interface technologies and features.
- **Backend**: Details the server-side configurations, focusing on security with JWT and RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: Provides insights into the data management strategy, highlighting MySQL as the storage solution with a description of key tables.
